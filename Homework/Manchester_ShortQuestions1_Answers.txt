Question 1 (5 points)
What is reinforcement learning? Compare it briefly with supervised and
unsupervised learning.
================================================================================

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to make decisions by interacting with an environment. The agent takes actions, receives feedback in the form of rewards or penalties, and learns a policy that maximizes cumulative reward over time. Unlike other learning paradigms, RL involves sequential decision-making where current actions affect future states and rewards.

Comparison with other learning paradigms:

- Supervised Learning: Learns from labeled examples (input-output pairs) provided by a teacher. The goal is to generalize from these examples to predict outputs for new inputs. The feedback is immediate and explicit (the correct answer is known).

- Unsupervised Learning: Learns patterns from unlabeled data without explicit feedback. The goal is to discover hidden structure, such as clusters or distributions, in the data.

- Reinforcement Learning: Learns from interaction with an environment through trial and error. Feedback comes as scalar rewards that may be delayed, and there is no explicit "correct answer" - only better or worse outcomes. The agent must balance exploration (trying new actions) with exploitation (using known good actions).
