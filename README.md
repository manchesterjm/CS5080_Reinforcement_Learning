# CS 5080 - Reinforcement Learning

**University of Colorado Colorado Springs | Spring 2026**

Graduate coursework for CS 5080: Reinforcement Learning with Dr. Jugal Kalita.

## Course Description

This course covers reinforcement learning fundamentals through modern deep RL methods:
- Markov Decision Processes (MDPs)
- Monte Carlo Methods
- Temporal Difference Learning (Q-learning, SARSA)
- Deep Q-Networks (DQN, Double DQN, Dueling DQN)
- Policy Gradient Methods (PPO, A3C)
- Actor-Critic Methods
- Monte Carlo Tree Search

## Semester Project

**Title:** Can Modern Deep RL Overcome Sparse Rewards? A Case Study in Minesweeper

**Research Question:** Can modern RL algorithms close the 87-point performance gap between pure DQN (1% win rate) and hybrid approaches (88% win rate)?

**Methods Under Evaluation:**
- DQN baseline
- Beta-DQN (behavior-driven exploration)
- Elastic Step DQN (reduced overestimation)
- PPO (Proximal Policy Optimization)
- SAC (Soft Actor-Critic)
- Reward shaping techniques
- Curriculum learning (progressive difficulty)
